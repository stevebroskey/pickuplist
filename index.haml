          %h3 What is PickupList?
          %p
            Steve came up with the idea of PickupList when he was
            traveling in an unfamiliar location and wanted to find a
            game of pick-up ultimate frisbee.  So Steve and Ian put
            their heads together to find a solution, and PickupList
            was the result.
          %p
            With PickupList, it's now easy to find local pick-up sports
            games when you're in an area that you're not familiar with.
